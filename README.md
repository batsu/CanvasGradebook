# CanvasGradebook
My ongoing attempts to make grading easier using Canvas Gradebook

If you use Canvas Gradebook Export for keeping track of assignments and use any sort of curving and/or scaling of your scores, this could be your new best friend!

Made this script to save me and my colleagues time.  As busy teachers, time is something we never have enough of.

Features:
  - Customize assignment list from current Canvas Gradebook (must convert .CSV to .xls)
  - Separates Periods into sheets
  - Can curve and/or scale grades

Future things:
  - Want to make a script to compare gradebooks and highlight changes in scores (cell color change for updated scores)
  - ???
